# INTRODUCTION TO AUTOMATION

This workshop is created to provide an introduction about the test automation. 

## Requirements

* Node JS (https://nodejs.org/es/download/)
* git (https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* Any code editor like VSCode (https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
* Chrome
* You will need to have an account in github

## Steps to run locally

1. clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/leonleo997/intro-automation-20211`
2. Move into the directory `cd intro-automation-20211`
3. install the dependencies `npm install`
4. execute it in watch mode `npm run test`
5. execute it in headless mode `npm run test:headless`

## The challenge

First, you will need to fork the repo and checkout to the branch `contact-test`. Then, you will need to find all the selectors that are needed to execute the `contact-us.test.js`. If you succeed, then the CI build should be in green! :D
